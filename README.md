## Usage

Clone this repo and run `npm install` inside it.

Before checking any of the included solutions you will need to:

0. Go to solution folder (e.g. `cd facebook-flux`, `cd redux`, etc.)
1. Run `npm install` to install dependencies of a specific app
2. Run `npm start` to build js resources with [Browserify](http://browserify.org)
3. Open `index.html` in the browser

## Demo

Select several products from _Flux Online Shop_ and add them to cart. Open browser console and click _Checkout_ button, you'll see payload with products that you just "bought".
